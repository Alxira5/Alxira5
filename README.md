# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Guillermo Brito or also known as Alxira5, I am software developer
and a digital artist, I am also a defender of free culture and that is why all
my projects are free.

I joined GitHub to host my projects and contribute to others, which is usually
very simple or a little crazy, but it is usually useful in some cases or a
little interesting.

If you want to contact me, you can write to my
[email](mailto:alxira5gl@gmail.com).
